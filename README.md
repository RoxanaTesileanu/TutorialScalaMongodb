Hi! This is a repository aiming at offerring an introduction into MongoDB and Neo4j in Scala. I will try to add codes as rapidly as I can, as it is on a voluntarily basis.
This will also document my progress in learning more advanced Figaro coding and principles of the Bayesian inference. 

NOTES:
- Observables and Observers of MongoDB behave like Promises and Futures in Scala, so I will give my best to use scala-native constructs in order to optimize the code.
- the neo4j driver is a java driver, but the interoperability between JVM languages will allow me to use its functionality.
- Figaro is a probabilistic programming language built on top of Scala and developed at CRA. I will try to learn how to build advanced algorithms and the statistical teory behind them.
